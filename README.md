# Library Management System

## Project Description
The Library Management System (LMS) is a web-based application that helps manage library operations such as managing books, authors, members, and their borrowing activities. The system is designed with a RESTful API that supports various CRUD operations for managing the library's resources and activities.

### Key Features:
- **Member Management**: Register new members, view members, and get member details by ID.
- **Book Management**: Add new books, update book details, remove books, and search books by title, author, and genre.
- **Book Borrowing**: Borrow books, return books, and view borrow history.
- **Search**: Search for books by title, author, and genre.
- **Overdue Books**: Check overdue books for specific members.
  
This system is built using:
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express
- **Database**: MySQL
- **Authentication**: JWT (JSON Web Token) for authentication and role-based access control.
